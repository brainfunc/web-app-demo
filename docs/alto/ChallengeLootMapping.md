# Challenge Loot Utilization
Following is the item exchange mapping from the thirteen(13) brain parts to the Challenge Loot Items. We plan to exchange a brain part of **strength one**<sup>**[1]**</sup>, with the corresponding Challenge Loot Item. The Mapping is based on common sense and brain part function. Items that are mapped are related in some way or the other to the function that the corresponding brain part performs. In cases where multiple items are mapped, any single item can be traded in exchange of concerned brain part.  

Given below is a summary of the **brain part function**, the **Mapped Item(s)** and **Why the mapping makes sense?**

## Frontal Lobe (Left, Right)
**Performs core cognition function** - Most important part, that controls important cognitive skills in humans, such as emotional expression, problem solving, memory, language, judgment, and sexual behaviors. The left part is associated with logical cognition, while the right with creative aspects.
### Mapped Items
Arcanist's Tome of Spells, Lamp of Wonder , Cards of Fate, Quill of Binding
### Why it makes sense?
Mapping it to seemingly most important items like Arcanist's Tome of Spells makes sense because the Frontal Lobe is the most important part of the brain, where all the magic happens.

## Occipital Lobe
**Visual processing function** - The occipital lobe is one of the four major lobes of the cerebral cortex in the brain of mammals. The occipital lobe is the visual processing center of the mammalian brain containing most of the anatomical region of the visual cortex.
### Mapped Items
Amulet of Dreams, Crystal Apple
### Why it makes sense?
Because amulets and crystals help see + derive meaning, hence involved in cognition + vision.

## Temporal Lobe
**Auditory / Hearing functions** - The temporal lobe is involved in primary auditory perception, such as hearing, and holds the primary auditory cortex. The primary auditory cortex receives sensory information from the ears and secondary areas process the information into meaningful units such as speech and words.
### Mapped Items
Haste Drums, Horn of Resounding
### Why it makes sense?
Because drums and horns mostly related to sound.

## Parietal Lobe
**Involved in time keeping** - The parietal lobes can be divided into two functional regions. One involves sensation and perception and the other is concerned with integrating sensory inputm. The first function integrates sensory information to form a single perception (cognition). This makes it involved in tasks sucj as perception of time, sensation and perception.
### Mapped Items
Mysterious Sundial, Bonekeeper's Hourglass
### Why it makes sense?
Hourglass, Sundial are related to time keeping, a function in which the parietal lobe is involved.

## Focculonodular lobe
**Involved in visual processing** - The flocculus is a part of the vestibuloocular reflex system and is used to help stabilize gaze during head rotation about any axis of space. Neurons in both the vermis of cerebellum and flocculus transmit an eye velocity signal that correlates with smooth pursuit.
### Mapped Items
Truesight Telescope
### Why it makes sense?
Because telescopes provide an ability to see, related to visuals.

## Anterior Lobe
**Regulates posture** - The hemispheres are separated from one another by a thin structure called the vermis, or "worm." The anterior lobe, or paleocerebellum, is the second oldest part of the cerebellum. It receives proprioceptive input from the spinal cord and controls the anti-gravity muscles of the body, thus regulating posture.
### Mapped Items
Battleplate of the Light's Watch, Half Plate of the Onyx Pack, Arcanist's Robes Taleweaver's Tunic, Bracers of Light, Bracers of the Aegis
### Why it makes sense?
Because armor would help maintain posture.

## Posterior Lobe
**Involved in Kidney and Urinary function** -
Two hormones are classically considered as being related to the posterior pituitary: oxytocin and vasopressin. These hormones are created in the hypothalamus and released in the posterior pituitary. Bad functioning causes frequent urination and kidney issues.
### Mapped Items
Alchemical Mug
### Why it makes sense?
Because drinking and kidneys are co-related.

## Midbrain
**Involved in Auditory Processing** - Midbrain, also called mesencephalon, region of the developing vertebrate brain that is composed of the tectum and tegmentum. The midbrain serves important functions in motor movement, particularly movements of the eye, and in auditory processing (also visual processing).
### Mapped Items
Taleweaver's Lute, Pathfinder Flute
#### Why it makes sense?
Since flutes and lutes are auditory based instruments.

## Pons
**Muscle communication, balance co-ordinator** - Besides the medulla oblongata, your brainstem also has a structure called the pons. The pons is a major structure in the upper part of your brainstem. It is involved in the control of breathing, communication between different parts of the brain, and sensations such as balance.
### Mapped Items
Flail of the Imperator, Grappling Hook of the Fox, Mace of the Light's Watch, Forestwalker's Longbow, Stalker's Hand Crossbow
### Why it makes sense?
Because weapons require a High Strength degree of muscle co-ordination and balance.

## Medulla
**Info carrier for body** - The medulla oblongata helps regulate breathing, heart and blood vessel function, digestion, sneezing, and swalLow Strengthing. This part of the brain is a center for respiration and circulation. Sensory and motor neurons (nerve cells) from the forebrain and midbrain travel through the medulla.
### Mapped Items
Scroll of the Light's Watch
### Why it makes sense?
Because it is a transfer of information part for executing functions.

## Basilar Artery
**Cognition based blood supply.** - The basilar artery carries oxygenated blood to the cerebellum, brainstem, and occipital lobes. The cerebellum helps with voluntary processes such as posture, balance, coordination, and speech.
### Mapped Items
Blood Amulet
### Why it makes sense?
Because it is associated with oxygenated blood supply to most important brain parts.

## Vertebral arteries
**Dexterity based blood supply** - Each vessel courses superiorly along each side of the neck, merging within the skull to form the single, midline basilar artery. As the supplying component of the vertebrobasilar vascular system, the vertebral arteries provide supply blood to the upper spinal cord, brainstem, cerebellum, and posterior part of brain.
### Mapped items
Longsword of the Onyx Pack, Twilight Scimitar, Taleweaver's Shortsword, Stalker's Dagger, Abhishek's Katar
### Why it makes sense?
Because weapon usage is based on Dexterity and Balance and Muscle control.
