# BrainFunc FAQs

## I don't understand this. What is the game about?
Brainfunc is an e-learning game where players construct different parts of the brain by collecting neurons. There are 13 different types of neurons (& brain parts). A player can buy neurons to construct brain parts, which can be used to fight battles. More neurons in a brain part mean more strength. 


In a battle, two players are paired and given an activity/task. For e.g - 'Listening to Music can be one such task'. Both players have to select parts from their collection that they think are involved in performing that activity/task. In the above example, choosing the Temporal Lobe (involved in hearing) would be wise.


Battles become progressively more complex and later involve combination of parts. A battle win leads to an increase in strength of the parts involved, making them more valuable on the market place. Higher strength parts also mean the player can fight higher stake battles. For more details about in-game concepts, you can refer to the [gameplay section](https://github.com/brainfunc/web-app/blob/dev/docs/gameplay.md)


## Do I need a lot of prior knowledge for playing the game?
No you don't need a lot of prior knowledge about getting started with the game. We will provide with a basic starter Knowledge.md file in order for you to skim through brain parts and their functions. That should be good enough to get you started.

## Where do I learn about brain part functions?
You can consult wikipedia, the internet or any other sources you like. We will provide with a basic starter Knowledge.md file in order for you to skim through brain parts and their functions. That should be good enough to get you started.

## What do I need to play the game?
You only need the chrome plugin [metamask](https://metamask.io/) with an account and real ether balance in it. There are no other special requirements to play the game. All the starter knowledge you need to win in battles and learn more can be found in Knolwedge.md file which we provide you upon registeration.

## What is Metamask and why do I need it?
Metamask is a chrome plugin that helps you create a digital wallet with a unique wallet address. You can use this address to receive and send crypto funds and store crypto currencies.For more information and installation instructions, consult this [link](https://metamask.io/)

## I'm a school. Can I get a discount for students?
We intend to deploy a mock version of the game on the Ropsten Test Network for children in schools. The battle tasks here will be basic and will help students learn about the functions of the brain. For more information on including this in the curriculum or being a part of our Olympiad program contact us at tejnikumbh@gmail.com 

## How do you make money?
The players can sell their parts on the marketplace for a price reflective of their part strength. The more the strength of a part, the higher it will sell. The company will take a 5% cut on any transaction taking place on the market place.


We also sell Neurons and charge schools for Olympiads.
