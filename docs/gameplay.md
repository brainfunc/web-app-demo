# BrainFunc Gameplay

## Overview

BrainFunc is an epic e-learning adventure powered by the blockchain.

In the game, you can collect neurons (crypto collectibles in the game), use them to construct your own unique brain parts (again crypto collectibles) and use them to fight epic battles! All this while learning about different parts of the brain and their functions. We know it sounds super intriguing and fun, and we can't wait for you to get started. Read on to get a primer about the general gameplay.

## Concepts

There are **thirteen(13)** different types of neurons (& correspondingly thirteen different brain parts).You can start off by buying neuron packs <sup>**[1]**</sup> on the game marketplace. These can then be used to construct brain parts which will be useful in fighting **battles**.

### (a) Battles
In a battle, two players are paired <sup>**[2]**</sup> and given a task. For e.g - 'Listening to Music' or 'Smelling a Jasmine Flower'. Both players have to select brain parts from their collection that they think are involved in performing that activity or task. A correct combination, coupled with the shortest time taken leads to a win. In case of a tie for both of these factors, we determine whose brain part combination has the maximum combined strength <sup>**[3]**</sup>


Battles can be more complex and tasks can involve usage of a combination of parts. A battle win leads to an increase in the **strength** of the parts involved, making them more valuable on the market place. Higher strength parts also enable the player to fight higher stake battles<sup>**[4]**</sup>

### (b) Strength

The strength of a brain part is the measure of it's valuability. The strength grows as a brain part wins more and more battles. Another way to grow strength of a part is to spend neurons to construct it, which can be bought on the marketplace.

Having said this, a higher strength brain part does not necessarily mean that the player shall win the battle automatically. We frame battles such that we pair similar strength opponents together, and even then the strength is used only as a tie breaker criteria. More important is judgement of the task at hand, knowledge and fast action.

## Collectibles

### (a) Neurons
These are currently the smallest indivisible units of crypto items. They are available in thirteen varieties corresponding to thirteen **Component Parts**. Having a neuron of specific type allows you to construct a component part of that type. You can add more neurons of the same type to increase the strenght of that part, as mentioned before. You can buy a neuron from the market place but the kind of neuron you get is based on luck. (We use a uniform distribution)

### (b) Component Parts
There are thirteen Component brain parts corresponding to thirteen types of neurons. They are enlisted below.

   - Frontal Lobe (Left and Right)
   - Parietal Lobe
   - Occipital Lobe
   - Temporal Lobe  
   - Focculonodular Lobe
   - Anterior Lobe
   - Posterior Lobe
   - Midbrain
   - Pons
   - Medulla
   - Basilar Artery
   - Vertebral Arteries

You can use Component Parts to fight battles. Elementary knowledge about functioning of each of these brain parts is valuable in a battle. Also, since battle tasks might involve usage of multiple parts, the more the parts you have in your collection, the better.

## Marketplace

The marketplace is where you can bring your entrepreneurship skills into action. You can buy or sell neurons as well as brain parts here. Neurons can be bought directly from BrainFunc. You can buy neurons
in packs of 1,3,10,20,50 or 100. Each neuron has an equal probability of being one of the 13 types of neurons, and you will have to unveil them to see what you get!

As a player, you can re-sell neurons of a specific type(s) or brain parts on the marketplace. A higher strength brain part will sell for higher value since acquiring strength is done only in two ways
- (a) By adding more neurons (which cost ether)
- (b) By winning battles (which is based on skill)

You can get cracking and sell your own unique brain part with your very own unique battle history on the marketplace. Each brain part of each player is unique because of it's very own unique battle history. Excited? We know we are.

## Metamask
To use BrainFunc, you will need to install MetaMask, a digital wallet. You will need to put money in it to make your first purchase. A good article about metamask usage can be found here.

# Footnotes
**[1]** You can buy a general neuron pack from the marketplace, which can contain any combination of the 13 types.

**[2]** The pairing algorithm is based on pairing players of similar strength.This is done deliberately to keep the game interesting and knowledge based as opposed to simply capital based.

**[3]** A battle result is decided on three factors
- (a) Choice of correct parts
- (b) Time taken to solve the task
- (c) Strength of the part combination

The order of priority is **a->b->c** ('a' being highest and 'c' being lowest priority)

**[4]** Higher stake battles are fought for higher win rewards. This means that the player who wins will have a higher absolute strength increase in case of a win, and will lose more strenght in case of a loss.
